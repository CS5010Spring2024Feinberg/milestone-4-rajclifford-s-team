### About/Overview

The problem facing us is that we need to represent in code a clinic that has rooms of patients and the staff members assigned to those patients, as well as all of their various functions. We accomplish this by using an MVC design pattern where the clinic is the model, a GUI is the view, and the controller takes user input from the GUI and directs actions in the model.

### List of Features

The clinic has the ability to:

- Get and set its name
- Add a room
- Add a patient
- Add a staff member
- Register a new patient in the clinic, can be done through GUI
- Get a room by its number
- Get all the rooms
- Register a new clinical staff member in the clinic
- Send a patient home, can be done through GUI
- Assign a clinical staff member to a patient, can be done through GUI
- Assign a patient to a room, can be done through GUI
- Get the patients in a room
- Find a patient by name
- Find a clinical staff member by name
- Get a patient's room
- Display available rooms
- Get a list of clinical staff members
- Show a list of clinical staff members on a GUI
- Check if a room is occupied
- Check if a patient is in an exam or procedure room
- Display a seating chart of the rooms
- Check for duplicate patients
- Get the room of a patient
- List all the patients with their information
- Find a patient by serial number
- Find a staff by serial number
- Add a visit record on a GUI
- Deactivate a staff member on a GUI
- Show a patient's details on a GUI
- Unassign a staff member from a patient on a GUI
- List the clinical staff and patient counts on a GUI
- List inactive patients for a year on a GUI
- List clinical staff with incomplete visits on a GUI
- List patients with multiple visits in past year on a GUI


### How to Run
Jar file Milestone_4.jar is located in /res directory
Steps:

Open Command Line or Terminal: Navigate to the command line or terminal on your computer.

Navigate to the JAR File Location: Use the cd command to change directories to the location where your JAR file is stored. For example: cd path/to/your/jarfile

3.Run the JAR File: To run the program, use the following command:java -jar Milestone-4.jar
(no arguments needed)



### How to Use the Program

Run the GUIDriver.java file as a Java application, and go through the menu and options displayed on the GUI as you so wish. You can perform any function in the manner described in the milestone 4 description.



### Example Runs

List any example runs that you have in res/ directory and provide a description of what each example represents or does. Make sure that your example runs are provided as *plain text files*.



### Design/Model Changes

Document what changes you have made from earlier designs. Why did you make those changes? Keep an on-going list using some form of versioning so it is clear when these changes occurred.



### Assumptions

List any assumptions that you made during program development and implementations. Be sure that these do not conflict with the requirements of the project.



### Limitations

What limitations exist in your program. This should include any requirements that were *not* implemented or were not working correctly (including something that might work some of the time).



### Citations

Be sure to cite your sources. A good guideline is if you take more than three lines of code from some source, you must include the information on where it came from. Citations should use proper [IEEE citation guidelines](https://ieee-dataport.org/sites/default/files/analysis/27/IEEE Citation Guidelines.pdf) and should include references (websites, papers, books, or other) for ***any site that you used to research a solution***. For websites, this includes name of website, title of the article, the url, and the date of retrieval**.** Citations should also include a qualitative description of what you used, and what you changed/contributed.
